# Eyboard

A simple browser app for practicing typing with 10 fingers.
Try it: [janhrcek.cz/eyboard](http://janhrcek.cz/eyboard/)

There are a bunch of free websites where you can practice typing with 10 fingers.

- [play.typeracer.com](https://play.typeracer.com/)
- [keybr.com](https://www.keybr.com/)
- [typing.com](https://www.typing.com/)
- [10fastfingers.com](https://10fastfingers.com/typing-test/english)

Each of those has some features I like, but also some features I don't like.
This project is my attempt to bring together all the features I like, while dispensing with everything I don't like.

# What I want

1. being able to type even after I make an error. This is how real world typing works, in that it doesn't stop you if you mistype.
2. mechanism that doesn't allow me to finish the text if there are some mistakes. Not punishing mistakes trades off speed for accuracy.
3. ability to set custom text to type. Typing the same things over and over is annoying.
4. no "countdown" before each typing session. Having to wait before typing lesson wastes my time.
5. no adds. I want clear, focused UI without distractions.
6. ability to track progress over time. I want to know what letters I am slow to type / which letters I often mistype.
